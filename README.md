## ü™õ Wireframe

## üé® Colour Scheme and Font

The font Arial and Helvetica is what is used for the memory card game site. As one of the key traits of the website is simplicity but catchy at the same time, this font was chosen as it is clear and understandable for all types of users that wish to access the site and play the game. The font sans serif was also used as the fallback in case Arial and Helvetica are not accesible.

![font](projectimages/fonts.jpg)

The colour scheme used in the backgroud of the game is light green. The colour used for different texts in the game varies from a colour of white to different types of green. This type of variety is a good mixture in creativity but also goes well with the layout of the game and the approach went with.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

The following project was made and created from the following languages:

-HTML5
-CSS3
-JavaScript

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to browse, source and select the right font needed for the memory game.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) was both used for version control and to make repositories.

## üó£Ô∏è Credits

The [CSS documentation at mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) was mainly used a key reference point, when stying the memory game using CSS features.

When creating the README file I used the website [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) aswell as using a [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) found on GitHub.

To create the features applied on the game I had sourced various videos on youtube that helped breakdown JavaScripts features and animations which I applied to my code [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0egyNvsN-Y).

[this blog on elated.com](https://www.elated.com/javascript-timers-with-settimeout-and-setinterval/) did help in understanding and applying the games timer.

When deciding on a game layout and design, I had already had a good idea of what i wanted but after looking online I went with a square/card layout which was help chosen from [helpful games](https://www.helpfulgames.com/subjects/brain-training/memory.html)

When trying to apply the cards correctly within the game i used [web design](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/how-to-build-flexible-modal-dialogs-with-html-css-and-javascript--cms-33500t) in helping me apply the right modal.

For Java Animations and understanding and inputting them correctly within a file I used [this site](https://css-tricks.com/getting-deep-into-shadows/).

To build table for the features testing i used [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/).

To build the wireframes for the webpage [figma](https://www.figma.com/files/team/1520135412037779099/recents-and-sharing?fuid=1520135407288540892) was used.

To source the back-ground image used within the main base of the game I used [unsplash backgrounds](https://unsplash.com/backgrounds).

## üß™ Testing 

Bugs - 

Experienced a bug on the next level and game completion pop up at the top of the game, the bug was through the level completion pop up which stated details of my github at the very top, just above the level completion message, this bug was showing at the end of every level and also once the game had been completed.

Another big bug which was identified later on in the project was the type of javascript version i was using in my js.file. This was causing issues and erros within the project but once the issue was identified and corrected all issues were gone.

Trailing slashes in the meta tags has brought up alot of errors when i put my html code through the validator, but once i had removed closing tags all errors was gone from the validator.

Code Validation - 

CCS code validation.

I used the [W3C Markup validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload) to check the validity of my CSS code.

This passed with no errors found.

HTML code validation.

I used the [W3C Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the validity of my HTML. 

From this check it highlighted a few info markers and one key error.
![htmlerrors](projectimages/htmlerrors.jpg)

Since went back to the index.html file and identified the error code proplem fixed and checked code against validator, now showing no errors.

![htmlfixed](projectimages/htmlcodefixed.jpg)

JavaScript code validation.

For testing the JS code I used [JS hint JavaScript validation service](https://jshint.com/)

No errors were found within the file.

Lighthouse testing.

The initial lighthouse test on the memory game page showed average scores for Accesibilty and SEO, but what was very worrying was the performance result.

![lighthouseresults](projectimages/lighthousetest1.jpg)

From the report generated from the lighthouse test I was able to identify what the main source of the problem was which was causing the performance issues. The main issue was that my background image in my game design had to be compressed and converted to a different format in order for to game to perform to its best ability. This change was made.
